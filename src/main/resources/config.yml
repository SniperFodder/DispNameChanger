# Message settings change the behavior of DNC in reguards to
#   the login/logout, kick, and death messages including the
#   display name.
# true: message should be changed to include display name.
# false: message should be left alone.
# ----
# Global-Announce sets whether a global announcement of display
#   names to users should be made whenever one is changed.
#   Target represents either Admins only, or All users.
# ALL: All users will recieve the name change broadcast.
# ADMIN: Only users with the permission node 'dispname.announce'
#   will recieve broadcasts.
# ----
# Prefix toggles whether a character is prepended to display
#   names. The default character is +. If a string is provided,
#   the first character in the string is used as the prefix.
#   If the string is blank, the default is used.
#   The prefix character MUST BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES (' ')!
#   The color code allows you to change the color of the prefix
#   to be used. You do not have to put a & or # to specify the color
#   code.
# Color Codes can be found here:
# http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_server_protocol#Color_Codes
# ----
# Scoreboard toggles the use of the scoreboard integration.
#   Note: Integration into scoreboard will force the player 
#   display names to be unique. Names longer than 16 characters
#   will be truncated on the player list. Each color code counts
#   for two characters.
# ----
# Language is used to set the language that the plugin will
#   use for it's messages.
# Valid values: en_US
# ----
# Commands allows a user to filter out commands from going under the
#   display name replacement process that allow the use of display
#   names in commands. i.e /msg SuperBob heya SuperBob how are you?
#   In the example, SuperBob would normaly be replaced by userbob225,
#   SuperBob's actual user name.
#   To use this feature, add a command followed by how many replacements
#   should be allowed. i.e. msg: 0 would completly prevent any names
#   from being replaced. msg: 1 would allow 1 name to be replaced, and
#   so on and so forth.
# Valid Values: Command followed by any integer between 0 and N where
#   N is infinite. If an invalid value or negative number is used, 0 is
#   used by default.
